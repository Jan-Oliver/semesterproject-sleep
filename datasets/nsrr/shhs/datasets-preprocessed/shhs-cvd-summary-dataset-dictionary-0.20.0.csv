0,nsrrid,NSRR Subject ID,This subject identifier was created by the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) team to more easily match with file downloads. Use 'pptid' to link with Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC) and cohort-specific data.
1,pptid,New SHHS participant ID assigned by BioLINCC,"This participant ID matches what is present in Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC). From BioLINCC, this column may be called 'npptid'."
2,vital,Vital status at last contact,"Deaths from any cause were identified and confirmed for the cohort using multiple concurrent approaches including follow-up interviews, written annual questionnaires or telephone contacts with study participants or next-of-kin, surveillance of local hospital records and community obituaries, and linkage with the Social Security Administration Death Master File. (For more information, see [Punjabi et al. 2009 (PubMed ID: 19688045)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19688045))"

37,afibprevalent,Prevalent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) at SHHS Visit 1,Variable created as part of the analysis for [Tung et al. 2017 (PubMed ID: 28668820)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28668820). Prevalent AF was defined by any of the following: a positive response to the question 'Has a doctor ever told you that you have or had atrial fibrillation'; AF identified on resting 12-lead ECG at the baseline SHHS exam; or if the parent study identified AF documented in the medical record before the SHHS baseline exam.
38,afibincident,Incident Atrial Fibrillation (AF) after SHHS Visit 1,"Variable created as part of the analysis for [Tung et al. 2017 (PubMed ID: 28668820)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28668820). Incident AF was considered present if AF was identified on a 12-lead ECG obtained at the second SHHS exam or was adjudicated by the parent cohorts at any time between the baseline PSG and the final follow-up date for AF ascertainment of June 30, 2006."
